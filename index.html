                I'm going to judge what they eat. But I would never. I just really want to educate you and have you learn how to make healthier choices without restricting or hard dietings. Life resolves around food, you should enjoy it.<br> My aim is
                to provide you with no- nonsense nutrition information that's easy to read, easy to understand and easy to put into practice. So you can enjoy my upcoming blogs.. cheers..much love.!<br>My field of interest for many years has been healthy
                nutrition, cooking and traveling.</p>

        <p id="sec3-p3">This easy cucumber and tomato salad tastes like summertime in a bowl. The dressing is light and zingy from the vinegar,,<br> the cucumbers and onion are so pleasantly crunchy you can’t stop eating them, <br>and the tomatoes are so juicy and sweet
            they
            <br> burst in your mouth. It’s perfect as a light summer snack, but would also be a great<br> side dish at any barbecue or cookout or even an addition <br>to other salads. Go ahead and make a big vat of this and keep it in the fridge. It’ll
            disappear in no time.
