        <h1 id=sec3-h1 class="sec-h1">My Recipe</h1>
        <p id="sec3-p3">This easy cucumber and tomato salad tastes like summertime in a bowl. The dressing is light and zingy from the vinegar,,<br> the cucumbers and onion are so pleasantly crunchy you can’t stop eating them, <br>and the tomatoes are so juicy and sweet
            they
            <br> burst in your mouth. It’s perfect as a light summer snack, but would also be a great<br> side dish at any barbecue or cookout or even an addition <br>to other salads. Go ahead and make a big vat of this and keep it in the fridge. It’ll
            disappear in no time.
